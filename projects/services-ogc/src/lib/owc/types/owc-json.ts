/**
 * In reality a resource can be realised in a number of different ways, and so an OWC document allows various options to be specified.
 * These are known as offerings.
 * The intention is that these are, as far as is possible by the format used,
 * equivalent and no priority is assigned to their order in the standard.
 * They are intended to be alternatives that the client can use to allow it to visualise or use the resource.
 *
 * So for example four offerings, a WMS, a WFS with portrayal as SLD, and an inline GML Offering again with portrayal as SLD.
 * Different clients could use these offerings as appropriate:
 * - a simple browser based client could use the WMS offering provided, using the standard portrayal
 * - a more sophisticated client, could use the WFS offering and the associated SLD Document.
 *
 * There are two types of offering, service offerings and data offerings.
 * A service offering has a service request (in the form of a capabilities request and a data request)
 * and optional content and styling elements.
 * A data offering has a content element and optional styling elements.
