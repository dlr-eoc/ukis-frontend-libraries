# @dlr-eoc/Utilities

A small set of utilities that are used in other @dlr-eoc libraries. 
Perhaps we could could replace some with something like https://lodash.com/ ->
https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash-es

This library was generated with
[Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.0.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project utilities` to generate a new
component. You can also use
`ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module --project utilities`.

> Note: Don't forget to add `--project utilities` or else it will be added to
> the default project in your `angular.json` file.

## Build

Run `ng build utilities` to build the project. The build artifacts will be
stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Publishing

After building your library with `ng build utilities`, go to the dist folder
`cd dist/utilities` and run `npm publish`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test utilities` to execute the unit tests via
[Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
