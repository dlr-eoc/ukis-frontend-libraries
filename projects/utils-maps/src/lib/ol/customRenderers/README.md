# Custom renderers

Since openlayers 6, maps have been broken into multiple canvases (one per layer).
The programmer has complete control over how image-data is placed in a layer's canvas.
To facilitate this new-won freedom, openlayers allows us to create our own custom renderers.

A renderer is in principle very simple. It needs to do but three things:
 1. provide a canvas
 2. implement the method `prepareFrame(frameState: FrameState): boolean`
 3. implement the method `renderFrame(frameState: FrameState, target: HTMLElement): HTMLElement`

The renderers in this directory serve as an illustration of the wide range of things we can 
do with this very general model. 

 1. `minimal_renderer` contains an absolute minimal example of what is required to create a custom renderer
 2. `dtm_renderer` illustrates how WebGL can make use of normal-maps 
 3. `particle_renderer` procedurally generates little white particles that move along a force-field (that the user may change at any point)
 4. `interpolation_renderer` does an inverse distance interpolation between a set of data-points on a per-pixel basis.
